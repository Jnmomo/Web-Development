					Salad<hr>
					Of course you gotta have your veggies. Not my favorite thing to eat but I have a secret dressing here to make salad more delicious:
					<br>
					<br>
					1 lemon and turn that into lemon juice
					<br>
					<br>
					some minced garlic
					<br>
					<br>
					two tbs of soy sauce
					<br>
					<br>
					two tbs of sesame paste
					<br>
					<br>
					some salt and pepper depending on your taste
					<br>
					<br>
					some water
					<br>
					<br>
					stir everything until mixed together and pour into your favorite choice of vegetables

				<div>
					Steak<hr>
					Cheat day! The most important part of this meal is to get some good quality meat. My favorite way to cook this is medium rare, NY strip. What else you need: some butter, garlic, rosemary, seasoning powder of your choice.
					<br>
					<br>
					1. Season you meat for about 30 to 40 minutes.
					<br>
					<br>
					2. Heat some olive oil in a non-sticky pan to medium heat, put meat in and cook for about 3 minutes.
					<br>
					<br>
					3. Flip side, add butter on top to melt, add garlic and rosemary on the side, cook for another 3 minutes.
					<br>
					<br>
					4. Voila!

				<div>
					Ramen<hr>
					What is better than a bowl of hot ramen with soup in a cold snowy day? Two bowls of ramen! What you need: your favorite brand of instant noodle, some vegetables, sausages, egg, dried seaweed, chicken stock.
					<br>
					<br>
					1. Add some water and chicken stock into a pot, heat to boiling.
					<br>
					<br>
					2. Add your noodle pack and seasoning powder, add vegetables and sausage, add egg last if you want runny yolk.
					<br>
					<br>
					3. After everything is cooked, you can add some cheese on top if you want. My finishing touch is to add some sesame oil. Pour everything out and add some dried seaweed.
					<br>
					<br>
					4. Bon Appetit!
